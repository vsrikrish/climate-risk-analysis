# Challenges and Appraoches: Modeling Exposure, Vulnerability, and Response

---
# Overarching Challenges
<hr>

Several categories of challenges for modeling exposure, vulnerability, and response:
- Downscaling uncertainties;
- Data collection/availability at appropriate scales;
- Dynamic changes due to endogenous dynamics.

---
# Downscaling Uncertainties
<hr>

Downscaling uncertainties can play a large role in short-to-medium term and highly local effects.

These are often neglected due to the complexity/computational storage needs for navigating large scale ensembles.

# Data Availability at Appropriate Scales
<hr>

What kind of data do we need to assess exposure, vulnerability, and response?

- Database of population/assets that might be exposued;
- How much damage could ensue from different events;
- Adaptation measures which have already been implemented;
- Extent to which further adaptation measures or responses might be triggered.

These are all high-resolution pieces of information which can be difficult to gather!

---
# Data Availability at Appropriate Scales
<hr>

For flood risk:
- Structure inventory in floodplain;
- Reasonable depth-damage curves (including already-undertaken adaptations);
- Socioeconomic/settlement data;
- Information about how people would respond to new policies/programs or dynamic hazards.

---
# Uncertainty in Damage Estimates

]

# Structural Uncertainty and Damages
<hr>

In addition to building stock uncertainties, structural uncertainty exists in mapping larger-scale hazards to local-scale assumptions.

For example, certain modeling groups and foundations may claim high accuracy, but their model isn't publicly available.

This raises the issue of implementation uncertainty, as well as those emerging from any modeling choices and issues of resolution/scale.

---
# Structure Inventory
<hr>

The [FEMA HAZUS database](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/hazus) is commonly used to estimate structures at risk, but exposure estimates are sensitive to building stock uncertainties:

# Socioeconomic Data
<hr>

Census/American Community Survey data provide a means to get at socioeconomic data.

- Census is more thorough, but only conducted every 10 years.
- ACS: Relatively small sample size

> The ACS sample size is simply insufficient to provide high-frequency data at high spatial resolution with low uncertainty levels...

# Socioeconomic Data
<hr>

This is a fundamental challenge: 

**How to get high-resolution socioeconomic data without violating privacy or introducing biases?**


---
# Endogenous Response Dynamics
<hr>

How to account for how people respond to dynamic hazards?

# Review: Attitudes Towards Risk
<hr>

Two scenarios:
1. A certain payout of $X$?
2. An uncertain payout of $X-d$ or $X+d$, both equally likely?

Note that both of these "bets" have the same expected payout $X$. But there are a variety of responses!

# Implications for Modeling Responses
<hr>

1. How is the system state translated into risk assessment?
2. Are decisions modeled directly or more abstractly?
3. What is the:
  1. utility function of the decision-makers?
  2. mathematical representation of response?

---
# Challenges for Modeling Responses
<hr>

- Available information
- Resolution/scale of agents/decision-makers
- Agent/decision-maker representation
- Decision rules/utility functions

---
# Challenges: Calibrating Decision Rules
<hr>

How can we calibrate decision rules?

- Data on outcomes or decision processes (surveys, experiments?)
- Statistical calibration can be challenging.
      - Often intractable likelihoods.
      - Hard to assess data biases.
- Often done through hand-tuning.
      - Overfitting?
      - Overconfidence?

# Key Takeaways

# Key Takeaways
<hr>

- Modeling exposure, vulnerability, and response is challenging for a variety of reasons.
- Data concerns/insights into decision processes can benefit from stakeholder engagement and input.
- Should consider structural uncertainty in all facets (including damage estimates);
- Think in terms of generative social science/exploratory modeling, not just for agent-based models.
- Institutional constraints add more complexity. and are often neglected or simplified.
