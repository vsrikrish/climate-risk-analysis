# Coastal Flood Risk
<hr>

Coastal flooding: this is our motivating problem in this course.

Let's think about this through our hazard-exposure-vulnerability-response risk model.

# How Are Local High Water Levels Measured?
<hr>

.left-column[
Tide gauge data comes in many "flavors", based on local tidal and diurnal cycles. 

**Mean Highest High Water (MHHW)** is the typical "extreme" sea level datum.]

These effects can be very large depending on the location.

For example, Norfolk (VA)'s relative SLR is primarily driven by subsidence due to aquifier depletion.

# Storm Surge

---
class: left

# Extreme Sea Levels
<hr>

Extreme sea levels are a combination of tidal extremes and (often) storm surge, or "storm tides".

--

Storm surge is the result of winds pushing water against the shore. Physical modeling of surges is complex &mdash; topography, storm intensity, size of cyclone, angle of approach, continental shelf slope, all matter! 

However, we can (and will!) model storm tides using extreme value statistics.

---
class: left

# Impact of SLR on Inundation Probabilities
<hr>

The shift in storm tide level needed for inundation with SLR changes exceedance probabilities nonlinearly.

.left-column[![Probability of Inundation With and Without SLR](figures/slr_surge_tails.svg)]

.right-column[
For the cartoon on the left:
- Probability w/o SLR: 1%
- Probability w/SLR: 4%]

---
class: left

# Key Question: Are Storm Surges Stationary?
<hr>

Common practice is to assume *stationarity* in future storm surge levels.

**However**:
  - SLR means more water to surge against the coast;
  - Considerable uncertainty about impact of climate change on tropical cyclone intensity.

# Some Evidence Tropical Cyclone Intensity Is Increasing

An increase is consistent with the energetic model from [Emanuel (1986)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/43/6/1520-0469_1986_043_0585_aasitf_2_0_co_2.xml), which models TC energetics as a Carnot engine.

# Potential Covariates for Storm Surge Intensity Changes
<hr>

Actually very difficult (as we will discuss later) to decide between:

- Temperature (global mean temperature or sea-surface)
- Climate indices (NAO, ENSO)
- Sea level anomalies
- Stationary!

# Local Dynamics Impacting Exposure and Vulnerability
<hr>

Characterizing exposure and vulnerability is highly local and reflective of many socioeconomic, infrastructure, and topographical factors:
- drainage and permeability;
- location of critical infrastructure;
- housing stock & location;
- economic and social inequities.

---
class: left

# Local Dynamics Impacting Exposure and Vulnerability
<hr>

As a result, it's hard to speak in general terms about potential impacts and their trends.

But:

- Migration and urbanization are key drivers;
- Coastal amenities seem to (presently) outweigh perceptions of risk in population patterns and housing markets.

---
class: left

# Human-System Responses
<hr>

Responses are also hard to fully characterize, but some relevant factors:
- Levee effect (back to White (1945));
- Transportation networks and evacuation;
- Increasing discussion of retreat from high-risk coastal cities.

---
class: left

# Some Important Considerations
<hr>

- Human-system dynamics are difficult to model well!
      - Precriptive vs. Descriptive modeling
      - Many theories of behavior
      - How do you account for heterogeneity and distributional outcomes?
- Uncertainties everywhere!
      - Several different building inventory models (*e.g.* HAZUS): these are often incomplete or rely on statistical interpolations.
      - Choice of digital elevation model also can make a big difference (*e.g.* [Schmid et al (2014)](https://doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00118.1))

# Flood Risk Management

class: left

# Coastal Flood Risk Management As a Decision Problem
<hr>

Some common objectives:

- Net costs/benefits;
- Reliability (minimizing flood probability)
- Expected loss of life.

These all raise additional questions about equity and ethics!

# Many Different Coastal Flood Risk Management Levers
<hr>

# Time Preference of Money
<hr>

Would you rather have $\$100$ today or $\$1000$ ten years from now?

--

Many economic reasons to value money/costs/benefits today more than in the future:

- Inflation;
- Technological innovation;
- Compounding value of alternative investments.

---
class: left

# Discount Rates
<hr>

These preferences are captured with the *discount rate*. Let $I$ be the investment level, $r$ the interest rate, then the return $R(t)$ is
$$R(t) = I(1 + r)^t \Rightarrow I = R(t) \times d(t),$$
and where the **discount factor** $d(t)$ is:
$$d(t) = \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}.$$

In this case, we interpret $r$ as the **discount rate**.

---
class: left

# Impact of Discount Rates
<hr>

The choice of discount rate plays a major role in any cost-benefit analysis. Consider an initial investment of $\$1000$:

| Years | 1% | 4% | 7% |
|:---:|----:|----:|----:|
| 1 | 990.05 | 960.79 | 932.39 |
| 10 | 904.84 | 670.32 | 496.59 |
| 50 | 606.53 | 135.34 | 30.20 |
| 100 | 367.88 | 18.32 | 0.91 |
| 200 | 135.34 | 0.34 | 0.00 |

---
class: left

# Relevant Considerations
<hr>

So, to set up the decision problem, need to decide:
- SLR model/included processes;
- How to model storm surge (*e.g.* stationary or not);
- How to treat changes in exposure/vulnerability;
- If endogenous responses will be considered;
- Key objective(s);
- Levers which will be included;
- Discount rates for future costs and/or impacts.

---
class: left

# What Will We Focus On?
<hr>

Going forward, in this class we will focus more on uncertainty quantification for the flood hazard:

- Calibrating SLR models and capturing uncertainties;
- Model selection and hypothesis testing for storm surge stationarity.

The main reason for this is that these are the most universal considerations given the local character and difficulties of the human-system elements of risk. But many of the techniques we discuss can be brought to bear on these components.
