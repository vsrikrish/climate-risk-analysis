# Uncertainty Quantification and Model Calibration

---
class: left

# What is "Uncertainty Quantification"?
<hr>

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is...

> the full specification of likelihoods as well as distributional forms necessary to infer the joint probabilistic response across all modeled factors of interest...
>
> .cite[&mdash; Cooke, *Experts in Uncertainty: Opinion and Subjective Probability in Science* (1991)]

---
class: left

# UQ vs. Uncertainty Characterization
<hr>

By contrast, **uncertainty characterization** involves mapping how alternative representations of the stressors and form and function of modeled systems influence outcomes of interest.

--

In short:
- UQ emphasizes probabilistic inference and projection,
- UC explores impact of alternative hypotheses and representations.

---
class: left

# UQ vs. Sensitivity Analysis
<hr>

**Sensitivity analysis** involves analyzing how uncertainty in the output is influenced by different sources of uncertainty in the input(s).

--

In short:
- UQ looks at the probabilistic representation of input(s) and output uncertainty;
- SA looks at the impact of variability in input(s) on outputs (for a number of purposes).

---
class: left

# When is UQ Appropriate?
<hr>

- Can specify a probability model to generate and/or draw inferences about data;
- Have sufficient data to constrain model adequately.
- Often need a model which is computationally inexpensive.

---
class: left

# Model Calibration
<hr>

A common UQ task is **model calibration**:

> the selection of model parameters and structures to maximize
the fidelity of the system model to observational data given model and computational constraints as calibration.
>
> .cite[&mdash; Oreskes et al (1994)]

We can calibrate *statistical* models or numerical *simulation* models.

---
class: left

# Calibrating Simulation Models
<hr>

Establishing some notation:

Let $F(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\theta})$ be the simulation model:
- $\mathbf{x}$ are the "control variables";
- $\mathbf{\theta}$ are the "calibration variables".

---
class: left

# Data-Model Discrepancy
<hr>

The other important consideration is **data-model discrepancy**.

If $\mathbf{y}$ are the "observations,"" we can model these as:
$$\mathbf{y} = z(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{\varepsilon},$$
where
- $z(\mathbf{x})$ is the "true" system state at control variable $\mathbf{x}$;
- $\mathbf{\varepsilon}$ are observation errors.

---
class: left

# Data-Model Discrepancy
<hr>

Then the *discrepancy* $\zeta$ between the simulation and the modeled system is:
$$\zeta(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\theta}) = z(\mathbf{x}) - F(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\theta}).$$

--

This implies that the "observations" can be written as

$$\mathbf{y} =  F(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\theta}) + \zeta(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\theta}) + \mathbf{\varepsilon}.$$

---
class: left

# Model Calibration and Discrepancy
<hr>

Model calibration then involves specifying a probability model for the data, which can include:
- Distributions/likelihoods for the calibration parameters;
- A probability model for the discrepancy and observation errors.

---
class: left

# What Happens If We Neglect Discrepancy?
<hr>

Neglecting discrepancy can result in biased inferences and, as a result, projections, as we will see over the next few weeks.

# Review of Frequentist Statistics and Sampling Distributions

---
class: left

# Frequentist vs. Bayesian UQ
<hr>

Recall:
- Frequentist statistics assumes that parameters of a given probability model have a "fixed" value corresponding to those statistics.
--

- Bayesian statistics assigns probabilities to parameters as part of the probability model based on the degree of belief about their consistency with the data (which is also random).

---
class: left

# Sampling Distributions
<hr>

A central concept in frequentist statistics (and to a lesser degree in Bayesian statistics) is the **sampling distribution** of a statistic, which captures the uncertainty associated with random samples.

---
class: left

# Sampling Distributions
<hr>

.center[![:img Sampling Distribution, 65%](figures/true-sampling.png)]

---
class: left

# Frequentist UQ
<hr>

Most frequentist UQ questions are centered around the sampling distribution, as it captures uncertainty from variations in the sample.

--

**But what if we only have access to one sample?**

In laboratory settings, can run multiple experiments, but this is not the case for the real world.

---
class: left

# "Classical" Approaches
<hr>

Classical statistical approaches involve relying on asymptotics or a special case distribution: 

Assume an approximation to the sampling distribution and analyitcally derive test statistics, confidence intervals, etc.

---
class: left

# The Bootstrap Principle
<hr>
.left-column[

What if we do not want to make these assumptions? [Efron (1979)](https://doi.org/10.1214/aos/1176344552) suggested combining estimation with simulation: the **bootstrap**.

The key idea: use the data to define a data-generating mechanism.

class: left

# Monte Carlo vs Bootstrapping
<hr>

**Monte Carlo**: If we have a *generative* probability model, simulate new samples from the model and estimate the sampling distribution.

**Bootstrap**: assumes the existing data is representative of the "true" population, and can simulate based on properties of the data itself.

---
class: left

# Why Does The Bootstrap Work?
<hr>

Efron's key insight: due to the Central Limit Theorem, the **differences** between estimates drawn from the sampling distribution and the true value converge to a normal distribution.

- Use the bootstrap to approximate the sampling distribution through re-sampling and re-estimation.
- Can draw asymptotic quantities (bias estimates, confidence intervals, etc) from the differences between the sample estimate and the bootstrap estimates.

---
class: left

# What Can We Do With The Bootstrap Sampling Distribution?
<hr>

Let $t_0$ the "true" value of a statistic, $\hat{t}$ the estimate of the statistic from the sample, and $(\tilde{t}_i)$ the bootstrap estimates.

- Estimate Variance: $\text{Var}[\hat{t}] \approx \text{Var}[\tilde{t}]$
- Bias Correction: $\mathbb{E}[\hat{t}] - t_0 \approx \mathbb{E}[\tilde{t}] - \hat{t}$
- Compute *basic* $\alpha$-confidence intervals:

$$\left(\hat{t} - (Q\_{\tilde{t}}(1-\alpha/2) - \hat{t}), \hat{t} - (Q\_{\tilde{t}}(\alpha/2) - \hat{t})\right)$$

# The Non-Parametric Bootstrap

class: left

# The Non-Parametric Bootstrap
<hr>

The non-parametric bootstrap is the most "naive" approach to the bootstrap: **resample-then-estimate**.

# Simple Example: Is A Coin Fair?
<hr>

Suppose we have observed twenty flips with a coin, and want to know if it is weighted.

T, H, T, T, T, T, T, H, H, H, H, T, T, H, T, H, H, T, T, H

Based on this sample, the frequency of heads is 45%.

.left-column[
If we generate 1000 samples:

.center[![Bootstrap Estimate of Heads Frequencies, 120%](figures/coin-bootstrap-small.svg)]
]

.right-column[
The 95% basic confidence interval is $(0.25, 0.65)$.

However, if we wanted to use this sample to bias-correct, we'd get an estimated bias of about 0, when the "true" bias is $0.6 - 0.45 = 0.15$.

# Simple Example: Is A Coin Fair?

What if we redo this with fifty realizations?

# Simple Example: Is A Coin Fair?

This illustrates the centrality of the assumption that the sample is representative of the population, given the lack of any parametric structure.

# Bootstrapping with Structured Data
<hr>

The naive non-parametric bootstrap that we just saw doesn't work if data has structure, e.g. spatial or temporal dependence.

class: left

# Bootstrapping with Structured Data
<hr>

For some structures (such as correlations), can transform the data to an uncorrelated sample, then resample and re-transform back.

For time series data, need to be more clever.

# Parametric Bootstrap

---
class: left

# The Parametric Bootstrap
<hr>

The parametric bootstrap is more interesting (and powerful) than the non-parametric bootstrap.

- **Non-Parametric Bootstrap**: Resample directly from the data.
- **Parametric Bootstrap**: Fit a model to the original data and simulate new samples, then calculate bootstrap estimates.

This lets us use additional information, such as a simulation or statistical model.

# Parametric Bootstrap For Time Series
<hr>

A simple approach to using the parametric bootstrap for time-series data: 

1. Specify and fit a trend model.
2. Calculate the residuals from the trend.
3. Resample from the residuals to generate new time-series.
4. Refit trend model to capture uncertainty.

--

This approach can be used for model calibration to capture uncertainty in parameter estimates.

---
class: left

# Parametric Bootstrap and SLR Data
<hr>

Using the discrepancy notation, this is:
$$\mathbf{y} =  F(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\theta}) + \zeta(\mathbf{x}) + \cancel{\mathbf{\varepsilon}}.$$

where:
- $F$ is the trend model (we'll use a quadratic);
- $\zeta$ is the data-generating model for residuals.
- We do not explicitly consider observation errors $\varepsilon$, as these are part of the residual process.

# Analyzing Residuals
<hr>

Now, let's analyze the residuals to see what probability model might be appropriate.

class: left

# Parametric Bootstrap and SLR Data

We can then fit an autoregressive model to the residuals and use that to generate new realizations.

]

class: left

# Parametric Bootstrap and SLR Data
<hr>

Finally, we refit the trend model to each realization, which yields sampling distributions for each parameter.

The 95% confidence intervals for each value:

| Variable | Sample Estimate | Bootstrap 95% Confidence Interval |
| :------: | --------------: | :----------------------------: |
| $a$ | $6 \times 10^{-3}$ | $(0.2 \times 10^{-2}, 1 \times 10^{-2})$ |
| $b$ | $-0.3$ | $(-0.6, 0.7)$ |
| $c$ | $-177$ | $(-240, 45)$ |
| $t_0$ | $1818$ | $(1757, 2175)$ |

We can also look for correlations across parameters with a pairs or corner plot:

# Sources of Error for the Bootstrap
<hr>

The bootstrap has three potential sources of error:
1. **Sampling error**: error from using finitely many replications
2. **Statistical error**: error in the bootstrap sampling distribution approximation
3. **Specification error** (parametric): Error in the data-generating model

- Model calibration is an important UQ task.
- **Goal**: identify model structures and parameters which are consistent with the data and our prior beliefs (in a Bayesian setting);
- Important to capture the model discrepancy in an appropriate fashion!

# Key Takeaways: The Bootstrap
<hr>

- The bootstrap is a powerful method to combine simulation and estimation.
- Several sources of error: of particular concern are statistical error and specification error (but this is always a concern).
- There are more sophisticated versions of the bootstrap for different data structures, e.g. the *(moving) block bootstrap* for time series data.
- The parametric bootstrap provides a method for UQ through the sampling distribution approximation.
