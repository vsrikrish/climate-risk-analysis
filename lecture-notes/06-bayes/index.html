# Review of the Bootstrap

---
class: left

# Last Class: Frequentist Statistics and Sampling Distributions
<hr>

**Frequentist UQ**: Capture the *sampling distribution* of relevant parameters.

This takes into account uncertainty in the data sample and reflects the impact of inference.

---
class: left

# Review: The Parametric Bootstrap
<hr>

.center[![:img Schematic for the parametric bootstrap, 65%](figures/pboot-sampling.png)]

---
class: left

# Review: The Parametric Bootstrap
<hr>

**Key assumptions**:

- Data is sufficiently representative of the population;
- Model structure reasonably captures data-generating process and/or residuals

---
class: left

# Sources of Bootstrap Error
<hr>

The bootstrap has three potential sources of error:
1. **Sampling error**: error from using finitely many replications
2. **Statistical error**: error in the bootstrap sampling distribution approximation
3. **Specification error** (parametric): Error in the data-generating model

---
class: left

# But What If We Don't Care About Frequency?
<hr>

For what might be called the "lab science paradigm," frequency properties are central to make inferences about relevant scientific laws.

But for risk analysis, do we care about them?

--

**Perhaps not!** A more relevant perspective: how much should we believe in a given level of a future or present risk? This is the perspective of *Bayesian statistics*.

# Introduction to Bayesian Statistics

---
class: left

# The Bayesian Perspective
<hr>

From the Bayesian perspective, probability is interpreted as the degree of belief in an outcome or proposition.

--

There are two different two types of random quantities:
- Observable quantities, or data (also random for frequentists);
- Unobservable quantities, or parameters.

We can also speak of probabilities on model structures, rather than framing model selection as hypothesis-testing.

---
class: left

# Conditional Probability Notation
<hr>

Then it makes sense to discuss the *probability* of
- model parameters $\mathbf{\theta}$
- unobserved data $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}$ 

conditional on the observations $\mathbf{y}$, which we can denote:
$$p(\mathbf{\theta} | \mathbf{y}) \text{ or } p(\tilde{\mathbf{y}} | \mathbf{y})$$

---
class: left

# Conditioning on Observations
<hr>

This fundamental conditioning on observations $\mathbf{y}$ is a distinguishing feature of Bayesian inference.

Compare: frequentist approaches are based on re-estimated over the distribution of possible $\mathbf{y}$ conditional on the "true" parameter value.

---
class: left

# Bayesian Updating
<hr>

Bayesian probabilities are conditional on observations.

This means that as make new observations, we can *update* them.

We do this using **Bayes' Rule**.

---
class: left

# Bayes' Rule
<hr>

Original version (Bayes (1763), *An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances*):

$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \quad \text{if} \quad P(B) \neq 0.$$

--

- Standard but important result in conditional probability
- As previously seen (hopefully remembered!) in Intro Stats
      - Monty Hall Problem

# Bayes' Rule
<hr>

Original version (Bayes (1763), *An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances*):

$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \quad \text{if} \quad P(B) \neq 0.$$

- Bayes used this to estimate the distribution of a probability $p$ of a binomial outcome (think success/failure).
- Richard Price (actual writer of quite a bit of Bayes (1763); see [Stigler (2018)](10.1214/17-STS635)) "rebutted" Hume by  "demonstrating" we ought to believe the sun will continue to rise.


---
class: left

# Bayes' Rule
<hr>

"Modern" version (Laplace (1774), *Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements*):

$$p(\theta | y) = \frac{p(y | \theta)}{p(y)} p(\theta)$$

---
class: left

# Bayes' Rule
<hr>

"Modern" version (Laplace (1774), *Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements*):

$$\underbrace\_{\text{posterior}} = \frac{\overbrace{p(y | \theta)}^{\text{likelihood}}}{\underbrace{p(y)}\_\text{normalization}} \overbrace{p(\theta)}^\text{prior}$$

---
class: left

# On The Normalizing Constant
<hr>

The normalizing constant (also called the **marginal likelihood**) is the integral
$$p(y) = \int_\Theta p(y | \theta) p(\theta) d\theta.$$

Since this *generally* doesn't depend on $\theta$, it can often be ignored, as the relative probabilities don't change. 

--

One big exception: model selection (will discuss later...)

---
class: left

# Bayes' Rule (Ignoring Normalizing Constants)
<hr>

The version of Bayes' rule which matters the most for 95% (approximate) of Bayesian statistics:

$$p(\theta | y) \propto p(y | \theta) \times p(\theta)$$

> "The posterior is the prior times the likelihood..."


---
class: left

# Bayesian Model Components
<hr>

This means that a Bayesian model specification requires two key components:

1. Probability model for the data given the parameters (the *likelihood*), $p(y | \theta)$t
2. Prior distributions over the parameters, $p(\theta)$
  - Can be independent or joint

--

**Bayesian updating**: Using the likelihood to "update" the prior probabilities of the parameters.

# A Coin Flipping Example
<hr>

We would like to understand if a coin-flipping game is fair. We've observed the following sequence of flips:

```
H, H, H, T, H, H, H, H, H
```

--

8/9 are heads, which might seem suspicious, but randomness can result in outliers like this.

---
class: left

# Coin Flipping Likelihood
<hr>

The data-generating process here is straightforward: we can represent a coin flip with a heads-probability of $\theta$ as a sample from a Binomial distribution,

$$y \sim \text{Binomial}(\theta).$$

---
class: left

# Coin Flipping Probability Mass
<hr>

Let's compare what the **probability mass functions** of these distributions look like for $\theta = 0.5$ and $\theta = 0.9$.

.center[![:img Binomial PMF, 50%](figures/binomial-pmf.svg)]

---
class: left

# Likelihood Function
<hr>

.left-column[The PMF told us what the probability of a given dataset was given a fixed parameter $\theta$. But we can view this same function from a different perspective: given the number of successes, how *likely* is a given parameter? ]

.center[![:img Binomial Likelihood, 50%](figures/binomial-lik.svg)]

---
class: left

# Prior Distribution
<hr>

For frequentist approaches, we could stop there and maximize the likelihood, and we'd get a maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta \approx 0.88$. 

But suppose that we spoke to a friend who knows something about coins, and she tells us that it is extremely difficult to make a passable weighted coin which comes up heads more than 75% of the time. Since we have a relatively small amount of data, this seems like valuable information to include, and we can do this through our prior.

---
class: left

# Prior Distribution
<hr>

.left-column[Since $\theta$ is bounded between 0 and 1, we'll settle on a Beta distribution for our prior, specifically $\text{Beta}(4,4)$, which covers a reasonable spread of possibilities while maintaining symmetry.]

.center[![:img Binomial Likelihood, 50%](figures/binomial-pri.svg)]

---
class: left

# Posterior Distribution
<hr>

Combining using Bayes' rule gives us a **maximum *a posteriori* (MAP)** estimate of $\theta \approx 0.74$.


.center[![:img Binomial Likelihood, 50%](figures/binomial-post.svg)]


---

# Bayesian Updating As An Information Filter
<hr>

- The posterior is a "compromise" between the prior and the data.
- The posterior mean is a weighted combination of the data and the prior mean
- The weights depend on the prior and the likelihood variances
- More data makes the posterior more confident (lower variance)

---
class: left

# Representing Uncertainty
<hr>

As with frequentist approaches, can reflect posterior inferences through a point estimate (mean, median, or some other *Bayes estimator*).

But more often, we want to capture the degree of uncertainty associated with a particular value.

---
class: left

# Credible Intervals
<hr>

Bayesian **credible intervals** are straightforward to interpret: $\theta$ is in $I$ with probability $\alpha$.

In other words, choose $I$ such that $$p(\theta \in I | \mathbf{y}) = \alpha.$$

This is not usually a unique choice, but the "equal-tailed interval" between the $(1-\alpha)/2$ and $(1+\alpha)/2$ quantiles is a common choice.

---
class: left

# Credible Intervals: Coin Flipping Example
<hr>

.left-column[In the case of our coin flipping example, how much uncertainty is there? Let's say we want to capture the 95% credible interval, which is $(0.48, 0.89)$.

]

.center[![:img Coin Flipping Credible Interval, 50%](figures/binomial-ci.svg)]



---
# Credible Intervals: Coin Flipping Example
<hr>

But that was for a simple example where it was easy to compute the posterior for a large number of values.

The easiest way to do this in general is through Monte Carlo: draw a lot of samples from the posterior and compute the empirical quantiles. We'll discuss later today/next week.

---
class: left

# More Complex Models
<hr>

One advantage of the Bayesian framework is it can be extended to more complex problems:

- Models with heteroskedastic residual structures:
      $$\begin{align}
      y(t) &= f(\mathbf{\theta}, t) + R(\mathbf{\phi}, t) \nonumber \\\\
      R(\mathbf{\phi}, t) &= \zeta(\mathbf{\phi}, t) + \varepsilon_t \nonumber
      \end{align}$$

---
class: left

# More Complex Models
<hr>

One advantage of the Bayesian framework is it can be extended to more complex problems:

- Hierarchical models:
    $$\begin{align}
    y_j | \theta_j, \phi &\sim P(y_j | \theta_j, \phi) \nonumber \\\\
    \theta_j | \phi &\sim P(\theta_j | \phi) \nonumber \\\\
    \phi &\sim P(\phi) \nonumber
    \end{align}$$

---
class: left

# Generative Modeling
<hr>

Bayesian models can also be used to generate new data $\tilde{y}$ through the *posterior predictive distribution*:
$$p(\tilde{y} | \mathbf{y}) = \int_{\Theta} p(\tilde{y} | \theta) p(\theta | \mathbf{y}) d\theta$$

This allows us to test the model through simulation (*e.g.* hindcasting) and generate probabilistic predictions.

---
class: left

# Role of the Prior
<hr>

There are two views on how to select prior distributions:

1. Priors as capturing by constraints/prior knowledge;

--

2. Priors as part of the data-generating process.


---

# On Uniform Priors
<hr>

What about uniform priors? 
- Unbounded uniform priors: often chosen to reflect ignorance, but nonsensical for data-generation;
- Bounded uniform priors: sudden transition from positive to zero probability is rarely justified.

---
class: left

# Considerations When Selecting Priors
<hr>

- **Informativeness**: How much information does the prior encode?
- **Structure**: Does the prior encode modeling features (*e.g.* symmetry)?
- **Regularization**: Does the prior yield more "stable" inferences (*e.g.* penalizing extreme parameter values)?

Also: what values are assigned zero prior probability? These values are ruled out from the posterior.

# Bayesian Computation: A Preview

class: left

# Goals of Bayesian Computation
<hr>

1. Sampling from the *posterior* distribution
$$p(\theta | \mathbf{y})$$

2. Sampling from the *posterior predictive* distribution
$$p(\tilde{y} | \mathbf{y})$$
by generating data.

---
class: left

# Bayesian Computation and Monte Carlo
<hr>

In other words, Bayesian computation involves Monte Carlo simulation from the posterior (predictive) distribution.

These samples can then be analyzed to identify estimators, credible intervals, etc.

---
class: left

# Sampling from the Posterior
<hr>

Trivial for extremely simple problems: low-dimensional and with "conjugate" priors (which make the posterior a closed-form distribution).

What to do when problems are more complex and/or we don't want to rely on priors for computational convenience?

# A First Algorithm: Rejection Sampling
<hr>

1. Generate proposed samples from another distribution $g(\theta)$ which covers the target $p(\theta | \mathbf{y})$;
2. Accept those proposals based on the ratio of the two distributions.]

.right-column[

class: left

# Rejection Sampling Algorithm
<hr>

Suppose $p(\theta | \mathbf{y}) \leq M g(\theta)$ for some $1 < M < \infty$.

1. Simulate $u \sim \text{Unif}(0, 1)$.
2. Simulate a proposal $\hat{\theta} \sim g(\theta)$.
3. If 
  $$u < \frac{p(\hat{\theta} | \mathbf{y})}{Mg(\hat{\theta})},$$
  accept $\hat{\theta}$. Otherwise reject.

# Rejection Sampling Intuition

We want to keep more samples from the areas where $g(\theta) < p(\theta | \mathbf{y})$ and reject where $g$ is heavier (in this case, the tails).

# Rejection Sampling Intuition
<hr>

.left-column[
In the bulk: $Mg(\theta)$ is closer to $p(\theta | \mathbf{y})$, so the acceptance ratio is higher.

In the tails: $$Mg(\theta) \gg p(\theta | \mathbf{y}),$$ so the acceptance ratio is much lower.
]
.right-column[
.center[![Proposal Distribution for Rejection Sampling](figures/rejection-cover.svg)]
]

---
class: left

# Rejection Sampling Considerations
<hr>

1. Probability of accepting a sample is $1/M$, so the "tighter" the proposal distribution coverage the more efficient the sampler.
2. Need to be able to compute $M$.

Finding a good proposal and computing $M$ may not be easy for complex posteriors!

**How can we do better?**
