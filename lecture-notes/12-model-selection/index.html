# Review: Model Assessment

---
class: left

# Is Our Model Appropriate?
<hr>

This means that are a large number of models under consideration.

In general, we are in an **$\mathcal{M}$-open setting**: no model is the "true" data-generating model, so we want to pick a model which performs well enough for the intended purpose.

The contrast to this is **$\mathcal{M}$-closed**, in which one of the models under consideration is the "true" data-generating model, and we would like to recover it.

---
# Model Assessment and Hypothesis Testing
<hr>

Evaluating the relative skill of different models can be thought of as a generalization of null hypothesis-testing.

- Can embed more nuanced and specific hypotheses;
- Compare proposed data-generating processes, instead of just comparing a "null" and an "alternative" under null assumptions.

---
# Model Assessment Criteria
<hr>

How do we assess models?

Generally, through **predictive performance**: how probable is some data (out-of-sample or the calibration dataset)?

# Parsimony and Model Selection

---
# What Is The Goal of Model Selection?
<hr>

**Key Idea**: Model selection consists of navigating the bias-variance tradeoff.

Model error (*e.g.* RMSE) is a combination of *irreducible error*, *bias*, and *variance*.

- Bias can come from under-dispersion (too little complexity) or neglected processes;
- Variance can come from over-dispersion (too much complexity) or poor identifiability.


---
# Bias-Variance Tradeoff
<hr>

.left-column[
If either of these is high, the model's predictive ability will be poor!
]

.right-column[
.center[![Bias-Variance Tradeoff](figures/bias-variance-complexity.png)]]

---
# Model "Complexity" and Bias/Variance
<hr>

Model complexity is *not* necessarily the same as the number of parameters.

Sometimes processes in the model can compensate for each other, which can help improve the representation of the dynamics and reduce error/uncertainty even when additional parameters are included.

---
# Occam's Razor
<hr>

Occam's Razor:

> Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity.

- Credited to William of Ockham
- Appears much earlier in the works of Maimonides, Ptolemy, and Aristotle
- First formulated as such by John Punch (1639)

# "Zebra" Principle

# Aside: What Error To Use?
<hr>

There are many metrics we can use to assess error.

**Common Framework**: Specify a *loss function* which penalizes based on deviation between prediction (point or probabilistic) and the observation.
- Zero-One loss
- Logarithmic loss
- Quadratic loss

---
# Aside: What Error To Use?
<hr>

Can also think of inference in terms of loss-minimization relative to "true" parameter values, *e.g.*: 
- the posterior mode minimizes the zero-one loss.
- the posterior median minimizes the linear loss
- the posterior mean minimizes the quadratic loss.

---
# Point Estimate Error Functions
<hr>

For point estimates, measures associated with loss functions are called "scoring functions" (overview: [Gneiting (2011)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jasa.2011.r10138)): 

$$\bar{S} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n S(x_i, y_i)$$

For example, the squared scoring function results in the mean-squared error.

---
# Probabilistic Forecasts
<hr>

For probabilistic estimates, these are called "scoring rules" (overview: [Gneiting & Raftery (2007)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214506000001437)) and are based on the probability assigned to the observed event by the forecast:
- Quadratic score
- Logarithmic score 
- Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)

---
# Log-Likelihood as Predictive Fit Measure
<hr>

The measure of predictive fit that we will use is the **log predictive density** or **log-likelihood** of a replicated data point/set, $p(y^{rep} | \theta)$. 

For normally-distributed data, this is proportional to the mean-squared error.

---
# Log-Likelihood as Predictive Fit Measure
<hr>

Why use the log-likelihood density instead of the log-posterior? 
- The likelihood captures the data-generating process; 
- The posterior includes the prior, which is only relevant for parameter estimation.

**Important**: This means that the prior is still relevant in predictive model assessment, and should be thought of as part of the model structure!

---
# Cross-Validation
<hr>

The "gold standard" way to test for predictive performance is **cross-validation**:

1. Split data into training/testing sets;
2. Calibrate model to training set;
3. Check for predictive ability on testing set.

---
# Cross-Validation
<hr>

**Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation**: Drop one value, refit model on rest of data, check for prediction.

This is related to the posterior predictive distribution
$$p(y^{\text{rep}} | y) = \int\_{\theta} p(y^{\text{rep}} | \theta) p(\theta | y) d\theta.$$

---
# Cross-Validation
<hr>

**Leave-$k$-Out Cross-Validation**: Drop $k$ values, refit model on rest of data, check for prediction.

As $k \to n$, this reduces to the prior predictive distribution
$$p(y^{\text{rep}}) = \int\_{\theta} p(y^{\text{rep}} | \theta) p(\theta) d\theta,$$
which is also the marginal likelihood of the model.

---
# Cross-Validation
<hr>

The problems:

- This can be very computationally expensive!
- We often don't have a lot of data for calibration, so holding some back can be a problem.
- How to divide data with spatial or temporal structure? This can be addressed by partitioning the data more cleverly (*e.g.* leaving out future observations), but makes the data problem worse.

---
# Expected Out-Of-Sample Predictive Accuracy
<hr>

Instead, we will try to compute the *expected out-of-sample predictive accuracy*.

The out-of-sample predictive fit of a new data point $\tilde{y}_i$ is

$$\begin{align}
\log p\_\text{post}(\tilde{y}\_i) &= \log \mathbb{E}\_\text{post}\left[p(\tilde{y}\_i | \theta)\right] \\\\
&= \log \int p(\tilde{y\_i} | \theta) p\_\text{post}(\theta)\,d\theta.
\end{align}$$

---
# Expected Out-Of-Sample Predictive Accuracy
<hr>

However, the out-of-sample data $\tilde{y}_i$ is itself unknown, so we need to compute the *expected out-of-sample log-predictive density*

$$\begin{align}
\text{elpd} &= \text{expected log-predictive density for } \tilde{y}\_i \\\\
&= \mathbb{E}\_P \left[\log p\_\text{post}(\tilde{y}\_i)\right] \\\\
&= \int \log\left(p\_\text{post}(\tilde{y}\_i)\right) P(\tilde{y}\_i)\,d\tilde{y}.
\end{align}$$

---
# Expected Out-Of-Sample Predictive Accuracy
<hr>

But we don't know the "true" distribution of new data $P$!

We need some measure of the error induced by using an approximating distribution $Q$ from some model.

# Kullback-Leibler Divergence

---
# Kullback-Leibler Divergence
<hr>

Suppose a distribution $P$ denotes "reality" and $Q$ is an approximating distribution.

Kullback-Leibler divergence: 
- Is a measure of the deviation between $P$ and $Q$;
- Has a connection to information theory (average number of bits to re-encode samples from $P$ using a $Q$-code);
- Can be interpreted as the "surprise" when using $Q$ as an approximation to $P$.

---
# Kullback-Leibler Divergence
<hr>

Formula for K-L Divergence:

$$D_{KL}(P || Q) = \int p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right)\,dx$$

Note that $D_{KL}$ is a *divergence*, not a *distance*, as it is not symmetric.

---
# K-L Divergence and Scoring Functions
<hr>

$D_{KL}$ is the divergence resulting from the logarithmic scoring function.

In other words, it is the natural measure of model error when using the log-predictive density.

---
# Computing K-L Divergence
<hr>

However, computing K-L divergence is fraught for model selection: we don't actually know the "true" data generating model.

# Information Criteria

---
# Information Criteria Overview
<hr>

"Information criteria" refers to a category of estimators of prediction error.

The idea: estimate predictive error without having access to the "true" model $P$.

---
# Information Criteria Overview
<hr>

There is a common framework for all of these:

If we compute the expected log-predictive density for the existing data $p(y | \theta)$, this will be too good of a fit and will overestimate the predictive skill for new data.

We can adjust for that bias by correcting for the *effective number of parameters*, which can be thought of as the expected degrees of freedom in a model contributing to overfitting.

---
# Akaike Information Criterion
<hr>

The "first" information criterion that most people see is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

This uses a point estimate (the maximum-likelihood estimate $\hat{\theta}_\text{MLE}$) to compute the log-predictive density for the data, corrected by the number of parameters $k$:

$$\widehat{\text{elpd}}\_\text{AIC} = \log p(y | \hat{\theta}\_\text{MLE}) - k.$$

---
# Akaike Information Criterion
<hr>

The AIC is defined as $-2\widehat{\text{elpd}}\_\text{AIC}$ (for "historical" reasons; this is called the deviance scale).

Due to this convention, lower AICs are better (they correspond to a higher predictive skill).

---
# Akaike Information Criterion
<hr>

In the case of a normal model with independent and identically-distributed data and uniform priors, $k$ is the "correct" bias term so that $\widehat{\text{elpd}}\_\text{AIC}$ converges to the K-L divergence (there are corrections when the sample size is sufficiently small).

However, with more informative priors and/or hierarchical models, the bias correction $k$ is no longer appropriate, as there is less "freedom" associated with each parameter.

---
# AIC: Example with SLR data
<hr>

.left-column[
Consider two SLR models:
- Quadratic
- Rahmstorf

We can think of these as alternative hypotheses about the influence of warming on SLR.]

.right-column[
.center[![MLE Fits to SLR Data](figures/slr-mle-fit.svg)]]

---
# AIC: Example with SLR data
<hr>

These both have four parameters (including the error variance), so $k=4$, and the difference is in the log-likelihood of the MLE estimate.

- Quadratic AIC: 895
- Rahmstorf AIC: 864

---
# AIC: Example with SLR data
<hr>

The actual values here don't matter; what's important when comparing models within a set $\mathcal{M}$ are the differences 
$$\Delta\_i = \text{AIC}\_i - \text{AIC}\_\text{min}.$$

Some basic rules of thumb (from [Burnham & Anderson (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124104268644)):
- $\Delta_i < 2$ means the model has "strong" support across $\mathcal{M}$;
- $4 < \Delta_i < 7$ suggests "less" support;
- $\Delta_i > 10$ suggests "weak" or "no" support.

---
# AIC: Example with SLR data
<hr>

.left-column[So in this case, the quadratic model has weak support relative to the Rahmstorf model, which might be interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that SLR increases are related to temperature increases.]

.right-column[
.center[![MLE Fits to SLR Data](figures/slr-mle-fit.svg)]]

---
# AIC and Model Averaging
<hr>

$\exp(-\Delta_i/2)$ can be thought of as a measure of the likelihood of the model given the data $y$. The ratio $$\exp(-\Delta_i/2) / \exp(-\Delta_j/2)$$ can approximate the relative evidence for  $M_i$ versus $M_j$.

---
# AIC and Model Averaging
<hr>

This gives rise to the idea of *Akaike weights*:
$$w\_i = \frac{\exp(-\Delta\_i/2)}{\sum\_{m=1}^M \exp(-\Delta\_m/2)}.$$

Model projections can then be weighted based on $w_i$, which can be interpreted as the probability that $M_i$ is the K-L minimizing model in $\mathcal{M}$.

---
# Aside: Model Averaging vs. Selection
<hr>

Model averaging can sometimes be beneficial vs. model selection, as model selection can introduce bias from the selection process (this is particularly acute for stepwise selection due to path-dependence).

# Key Takeaways

---
# Key Takeaways
<hr>

- Model selection is a balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting).
- For predictive assessment, leave-one-out cross-validation is an ideal, but hard to implement in practice (particularly for time series).
- AIC and DIC can be used to approximate K-L divergence and leave-one-out cross-validation.
- BIC is an entirely different measure, approximating the prior predictive distribution.

---
# Key Consideration
<hr>

**Model selection can result in significant biases when separated from hypothesis-driven model development.**

- There's no free lunch: better off thinking about the scientific or engineering problem you want to solve and use domain knowledge/checks rather than throwing a large number of possible models into the machinery.
- Regularizing priors reduce potential for overfitting.
- Model averaging ([Hoeting et al (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1214/ss/1009212519)) and stacking ([Yao et al (2018)](10.1214/17-BA1091)) can combine multiple models as an alternative to selection.
