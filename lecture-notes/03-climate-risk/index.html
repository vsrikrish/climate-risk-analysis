# Climate Risk Management
<hr>

Climate risk can be the result of any (or several!) of these processes.

This makes risk management potentially complicated: there are several possible intervention points, with (often uncertain) downstream implications.

# Climate Risk Management Levers
<hr>

Climate risk management involves choosing among/between this portfolio of approaches, based on a number of factors, including:
- **Relevant uncertainties**
- **Differing spatial/time scales**
- Costs/**benefits**
- **Reliability**
- Stakeholder preferences and values

---
# Climate Risk: Types of Uncertainties
<hr>

To make things more complicated: climate-relevant uncertainties include both "well-characterized" and "deep" uncertainties, and these uncertainties can be *dynamic*.

- **"Well-characterized" uncertainties**: Those for which we can broadly agree on probability distributions (*e.g.* climate sensitivity)
- **"Deep" uncertainties**: Those for which there is no consensus distribution (*e.g.* future economic growth)

***More on deep uncertainty later...***

# Impact of Correlated Uncertainties
<hr>

.left-column[
Many relevant uncertainties, even those that are well-characterized, are subject to **correlations**, which can complicate standard statistical approaches assuming independence.

# Role of Risk Analysis

# Risk Analysis for Decision Support
<hr>

The key goal of risk analysis is providing information to help navigate risk management decisions, which may involve differing:
- Perceptions of exposure/vulnerability
- Assessments of hazard probabilities
- Utilities of anticipated losses

Two scenarios:

# Expected Utility and Risk Analysis
<hr>

Many value-laden questions about utility and risk:
- *Whose* utility should we consider?
- How do we aggregate utilities?
- Do people even have well-defined and consistent utility functions and preferences?
- Is utility-maximization (*rational agent assumption*) actually an appropriate perspective or an accurate description of risk-averse/risk-seeking behavior?
- How can we capture inequities or injustices? Should we?

---
class: left

# Expected Utility and Deep Uncertainty
<hr>

Expected utility theory requires the ability to calculate expectations, which requires probabilities. 

But climate risk, as we've seen, involves *deep* uncertainties. What are the implications?

# "Unknown Unknowns"
<hr>

> Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are **known knowns; there are things we know we know**. We also know there are **known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know**. But there are also **unknown unknowns &mdash; the ones we don't know we don't know**. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.<br>

# Climate Change and Deep Uncertainty
<hr>

There are many deep climate-relevant uncertainties, including:
- socioeconomic development &Rightarrow; emissions;
- technological change;
- politics and policy;
- certain geophysical processes (*e.g.* Antarctic MICI/MISI);
- human-system responses

---
class: left

# Scenarios
<hr>

Deep uncertainties are often represented using *scenarios* or future *states of the world*.

For some, "scenario" implies narrative coherence: we will not require this.

# Scenarios of Future Climate Change

Future changes to the climate (from socioeconomic development and emissions) are an example of scenario usage.

# These Scenarios Are Used to Run Global Climate Models
<hr>

.left-column[**Global Climate Models** (GCMs) are very computationally complex, so their runs are often limited to these scenarios.

# Simple Climate Models vs. GCMs
<hr>

So-called "simple" climate models can be used to fill in the gaps (more on this in your lab), as they can run more rapidly at the expense of simplified dynamics/more aggregated output.

# Decision-Making and Deep Uncertainty

class: left

# Deep Uncertainty and Utility
<hr>

How do people make decisions under deep uncertainty?

Let's consider a famous experiment (published in 1961) by Daniel Ellsberg.


---
class: left

# Two Urn Game
<hr>

Consider two urns, each containing 100 balls. **Urn A** has 50 red, 50 black balls, **Urn B** is an unknown mix.

You are offered the following bets:
- **Bet 1A**: get $\$1$ if red ball drawn from Urn A, else $\$0$.
- **Bet 2A**: get $\$1$ if black ball drawn from Urn A, else $\$0$.
- **Bet 1B**: get $\$1$ if red ball drawn from Urn B, else $\$0$.
- **Bet 2B**: get $\$1$ if black ball drawn from Urn B, else $\$0$.

---
class: left

# The Ellsberg Paradox (Part 1)
<hr>

Participants in this experiment were indifferent between 1A and 2A, which is consistent with expected utility theory.

But they also strictly preferred 1A to 1B and 2A to 2B, even though there was no reason to expect that Urn 2 was stacked against them.

--

**Interpretation**: People have an aversion to deep uncertainty.

---
class: left

# One-Urn Game
<hr>

Now there is only one urn, with *30 red balls* and *60 (black or yellow) balls* (in unknown proportions)

Four bets:
- **Bet A**: you win $\$100$ if you draw a red ball;
- **Bet B**: you win $\$100$ if you draw a black ball;
- **Bet C**: you win $\$100$ if you draw a red or yellow ball;
- **Bet D**: you win $\$100$ if you draw a black or yellow ball;

---
class: left

# The Ellsberg Paradox (Part 2)
<hr>

Ellsberg found subjects prefer Bet A to Bet B. This is consistent with the Two Urn game: deep uncertainty aversion.

--

However: Subjects also preferred Bet D to Bet C. Why is this strange?

--

Expected utility theory implies that people's preferences are reflective of their beliefs about probabilities. 

But the combination of these two bet preferences is **inconsistent** with any consistent assignment of probabilities!

---
# Implications for Climate Scenarios
<hr>

The decision to make climate scenarios (SSPs/RCPs) probability-free is defensible (though was debatable at the time, see [Schneider et al (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1014276210717)).

However:
- Debate over scenario plausibility;
- "Misuse" of scenarios;
- Overemphasis of RCP 8.5 in impacts literature (*availability heuristic*);
- Aversion to deep uncertainty.
