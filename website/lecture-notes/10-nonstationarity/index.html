# Two Common Approaches to Modeling Extremes
<hr>

.left-column[
**Block Maxima**:

- Find maxima for independent blocks from time series;
- Can be inefficient use of data.
]

.right-column[
**Peaks Over Thresholds**:

- Set threshold and model level of exceedance *conditional on exceedance*;
- Choices of threshold and declustering length.

# Block Maxima: Generalized Extreme Value Distributions
<hr>

GEV distributions have three parameters:
- location $\mu$;
- scale $\sigma > 0$;
- shape $\xi$.

---
# Generalized Extreme Value Distributions
<hr>

.left-column[
The shape parameter $\xi$ is particularly influential, as the GEV distribution can take on three shapes depending on its sign.
]

# GEV Types
<hr>

.left-column[
- $\xi > 0$: Frechet (*heavy-tailed*)
- $\xi = 0$: Gumbel (*light-tailed*)
- $\xi < 0$: Weibull (*bounded*)

# Peaks Over Thresholds: Generalized Pareto Distributions
<hr>

Similarly to the GEV distribution, the GPD distribution has three parameters:
- location $\mu$;
- scale $\sigma > 0$;
- shape $\xi$.

---
# Generalized Pareto Distributions Types
<hr>

.left-column[
- $\xi > 0$: *heavy-tailed*
- $\xi = 0$: *light-tailed*
- $\xi < 0$: *bounded*

# Poisson-GP Processes
<hr>

GPD model exceedances over threshold.

Often pair with Poisson processes to model the number of exceedances in a unit period.

---
# GEV vs. PP-GP
<hr>

**GEV Model**: For each time period, what is the largest event?

**PP-GP**: For each time period, how many exceedances of threshold, and how large is each one?

---
# Return Levels
<hr>

$m$-period return level: How large is the expected event which occurs with this frequency?

Alternative explanation: Exceedance probability of $1-1/m$.

# Nonstationarity

---
# Climate Change and Nonstationarity
<hr>

However, these models assume *no long-term trend* in the data, so no change in the distribution of annual extremes.

This situation is called **stationary**: the underlying probability distribution does not change over time.

---
# Climate Change and Nonstationarity
<hr>

But climate change risks are fundamentally about dynamic distributions!

- Storm tracks/intensities
- Frequencies of extremes (heat waves, droughts, atmospheric rivers, etc.)
- Correlations between extreme events

--

This means that we need to consider **nonstationarity**: the statistical model has a dependence on time (explicitly or implicitly).

---
# Testing for Nonstationarity
<hr>

Commonly used: **Mann-Kendall Test**.

$$S = \sum\_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum\_{j=i+1}^n \text{sgn}(y\_i - y\_j),$$

Null hypothesis (zero trend): 

$$S \sim \text{Normal}\left(0, \frac{2(2n+5)}{9n(n-1)}\right)$$

---
# Aside: Null-Hypothesis Significance Tests
<hr>

Mann-Kendall fits into the framework of **null-hypothesis significance tests (NHST)**.

This aligns with falsificationist scientific paradigm. The test is whether to reject a *null* hypothesis in favor of the existence of a relationship.

- *Null hypothesis*: Typically that the proposed relationship does not exist.
- *Alternative hypothesis*: The relationship does exist.

---
# Aside: Null-Hypothesis Significance Tests
<hr>

For example:
- Null: No effect in a regression model (coefficient is zero)
- Alternative: Effect is non-zero

Or:
- Null: No trend over time
- Alternative: Trend exists

---
# Statistical Significance
<hr>

The "significance" in NHST is based on the frequentist notion of sampling distributions.

**Goal**: try to identify whether the pattern in your data is strong enough that it likely did not emerge due to sampling chance.

This involves balancing *Type I* (false positive) and *Type II* (false negative) error rates. 

---
# Type I and Type II Errors
<hr>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td colspan="2">Null Hypothesis Is</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>True</td>
    <td>False </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Decision About Null Hypothesis</td>
    <td>Don't reject</td>
    <td>True negative (probability $1-\alpha$)</td>
    <td>Type II error (false negative, probability $\beta$)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reject</td>
    <td>Type I Error (false positive, probability $\alpha$)</td>
    <td>True positive (probability $1-\beta$)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The **significance level** $\alpha$ is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis **assuming that it is true** (Type I errror).


---
# p-values
<hr>

The **p-value** captures the probability of observing results **at least as extreme as observed** under the null hypothesis.

Therefore, if a p-value is small (below $\alpha$), it can mean:

1. The null hypothesis is not true for that data;
2. The null hypothesis *is* true and the data is an outlying sample.

**Notice**: the $p$-value is itself a random variable; it is contingent on the sample. 

---
# p-values
<hr>

What a p-value is **not**:

- Probability that the null hypothesis is true (this is meaningless in the frequentist paradigm);
- Probability that the effect was produced by chance alone (a p-value is conditional on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true)
- An indication of the effect size

These misunderstandings are behind the replication crisis...

---
# Mann-Kendall Test
<hr>

$$S = \sum\_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum\_{j=i+1}^n \text{sgn}(y\_i - y\_j),$$

Null hypothesis (zero trend): 

$$S \sim \text{Normal}\left(0, \frac{2(2n+5)}{9n(n-1)}\right)$$

---
# "Problems" with Mann-Kendall
<hr>

However:

- Mann-Kendall only suggests the presence of a trend, not its magnitude (general problem with statistical significance tests: what is the effect size?);
- Doesn't work if the trend is oscillating.

---
# Alternative: Model Selection
<hr>

We can also fit stationary and non-stationary models and see how they perform, and select accordingly.

Will discuss fitting today, selection after break.

---
# Modeling Nonstationarity
<hr>

Typically assume one (or more parameters) depend on another variable which can vary in time.

For example, could model block maxima as $\text{GEV}(\mu(t), \sigma, \xi)$, or frequency of occurrence as $\text{Poisson}(\lambda(t))$.

Often these are linear or generalized linear models:

$$\mu(t) = h(\sum_{i=0}^n \beta_i t^i).$$

---
# Modeling Nonstationarity
<hr>

- While any parameters can be treated as nonstationary, making models too complex can make them difficult to constrain given limited extremes data.

- Shape parameters are difficult to constrain normally, so are often best left constant.

---
# Nonstationary Return Levels
<hr>

Since we have a different model for each time $t$, we get different return levels for different times.

Contrast this with the stationary condition, in which we can just speak of "return levels".

---
# Tide Gauge Example
<hr>

Let's look at the San Francisco tide gauge data.

What are the implications of:
- Nonstationary GEV?
- Nonstationary Poisson rate?
- Nonstationary GPD?]

# Nonstationary BLock Maxima Model
<hr>

Let's fit a GEV with a linear trend in time: $\mu(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t$, where $t$ is in years.

# Choice of Models

# Possible Covariates
<hr>

The candidate set of covariates is going to depend on the application.

For example, for storm surge, changes could be related to:

- sea-surface temperatures
- climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation, Southern Oscillation)
- local mean sea level
- global mean temperature (as a broad proxy)
- time (general trend)

# Key Takeaways

# Key Takeaways
<hr>

- **Nonstationarity**: Dynamic changes in the probability distribution
- Can be particularly hard to model/constrain with extremes due to limited data.
- Wise to avoid changing shape parameters.
- Nonstationary models can have very different return levels, so there are real implications for risk management.
- One possible path: adaptive decisions based on learning.
