# Review of Extreme Value Models

# Two Common Approaches to Modeling Extremes
<hr>

.left-column[
**Block Maxima**:

- Find maxima for independent blocks from time series;
- Can be inefficient use of data.
]

.right-column[
**Peaks Over Thresholds**:

- Set threshold and model level of exceedance *conditional on exceedance*;
- Choices of threshold and declustering length.
]

# Block Maxima: Generalized Extreme Value Distributions
<hr>

GEV distributions have three parameters:
- location $\mu$;
- scale $\sigma > 0$;
- shape $\xi$.

---
# Generalized Extreme Value Distributions
<hr>

.left-column[
The shape parameter $\xi$ is particularly influential, as the GEV distribution can take on three shapes depending on its sign.
]

.right-column[
.center[![GEV Distribution Types](figures/gev-shape.svg)]
]

---
# GEV Types
<hr>

.left-column[
- $\xi > 0$: Frechet (*heavy-tailed*)
- $\xi = 0$: Gumbel (*light-tailed*)
- $\xi < 0$: Weibull (*bounded*)
]

.right-column[
.center[![GEV Distribution Types](figures/gev-shape.svg)]

# Peaks Over Thresholds: Generalized Pareto Distributions
<hr>

Similarly to the GEV distribution, the GPD distribution has three parameters:
- location $\mu$;
- scale $\sigma > 0$;
- shape $\xi$.

---
# Generalized Pareto Distributions Types
<hr>

.left-column[
- $\xi > 0$: *heavy-tailed*
- $\xi = 0$: *light-tailed*
- $\xi < 0$: *bounded*
]

.right-column[

# Poisson-GP Processes
<hr>

GPD model exceedances over threshold.

Often pair with Poisson processes to model the number of exceedances in a unit period.

---
# GEV vs. PP-GP
<hr>

**GEV Model**: For each time period, what is the largest event?

**PP-GP**: For each time period, how many exceedances of threshold, and how large is each one?

---
# Return Levels
<hr>

$m$-period return level: How large is the expected event which occurs with this frequency?

Alternative explanation: Exceedance probability of $1-1/m$.

# Nonstationarity

---
# Climate Change and Nonstationarity
<hr>

However, these models assume *no long-term trend* in the data, so no change in the distribution of annual extremes.

This situation is called **stationary**: the underlying probability distribution does not change over time.

---
# Climate Change and Nonstationarity
<hr>

But climate change risks are fundamentally about dynamic distributions!

- Storm tracks/intensities
- Frequencies of extremes (heat waves, droughts, atmospheric rivers, etc.)
- Correlations between extreme events

--

This means that we need to consider **nonstationarity**: the statistical model has a dependence on time (explicitly or implicitly).

---
# Testing for Nonstationarity
<hr>

Commonly used: **Mann-Kendall Test**.

$$S = \sum\_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum\_{j=i+1}^n \text{sgn}(y\_i - y\_j),$$

Null hypothesis (zero trend): 

$$S \sim \text{Normal}\left(0, \frac{2(2n+5)}{9n(n-1)}\right)$$

---
# Problem with Mann-Kendall
<hr>

However:

- Mann-Kendall only suggests the presence of a trend, not its magnitude;
- Doesn't work if the trend is oscillating.

---
# Alternative: Model Selection
<hr>

We can also fit stationary and non-stationary models and see how they perform, and select accordingly.

Will discuss fitting today, selection after break.

---
# Modeling Nonstationarity
<hr>

Typically assume one (or more parameters) depend on another variable which can vary in time.

For example, could model block maxima as $\text{GEV}(\mu(t), \sigma, \xi)$, or frequency of occurrence as $\text{Poisson}(\lambda(t))$.

Often these are linear or generalized linear models:

$$\mu(t) = h(\sum_{i=0}^n \beta_i t^i).$$

---
# Modeling Nonstationarity
<hr>

- While any parameters can be treated as nonstationary, making models too complex can make them difficult to constrain given limited extremes data.

- Shape parameters are difficult to constrain normally, so are often best left constant.

---
# Nonstationary Return Levels
<hr>

Since we have a different model for each time $t$, we get different return levels for different times.

Contrast this with the stationary condition, in which we can just speak of "return levels".

---
# Tide Gauge Example
<hr>

Let's look at the San Francisco tide gauge data.

What are the implications of:
- Nonstationary GEV?
- Nonstationary Poisson rate?
- Nonstationary GPD?]

---
# Nonstationary BLock Maxima Model
<hr>

Let's fit a GEV with a linear trend in time: $\mu(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t$, where $t$ is in years.

---

# Choice of Models

---
# Possible Covariates
<hr>

The candidate set of covariates is going to depend on the application.

For example, for storm surge, changes could be related to:

- sea-surface temperatures
- climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation, Southern Oscillation)
- local mean sea level
- global mean temperature (as a broad proxy)
- time (general trend)

# Key Takeaways

---
# Key Takeaways
<hr>

- **Nonstationarity**: Dynamic changes in the probability distribution
- Can be particularly hard to model/constrain with extremes due to limited data.
- Wise to avoid changing shape parameters.
- Nonstationary models can have very different return levels, so there are real implications for risk management.
- One possible path: adaptive decisions based on learning.
