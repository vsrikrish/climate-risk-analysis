# BEE 6940: Climate Risk Analysis
@@

# Course Description

The impacts of climate variability and change are subject to a number of deep and dynamic uncertainties which complicate systems design and management. Using coastal flood risk management as motivation, this course will introduce concepts and methods for uncertainty characterization and quantification for systems experiencing dynamic environmental risk and will explore implications of uncertainty for decision-making. Students will develop and apply these uncertainty and decision analyses in the context of several example systems. 

\note{This course will use the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language. No prior knowledge of Julia is required.

# Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this class, students should be able to:

1. Identify pathways through which climate variability and change poses risks;
2. Assess system and model responses to varying factors with sensitivity analysis and exploratory modeling;
3. Quantify uncertainties when appropriate using methods from frequentist and Bayesian statistics;
4. Analyze the influence of uncertainty on risk management and decision-making.

# Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
* Systems thinking and analysis;
* Introductory probability and statistics;
* Calculus;
* Basic programming concepts.

In Cornell terms: roughly BEE 4750, CEE 3040 or ENGRD 2700, MATH 1920, or with permission of instructor.
