# Class Schedule
@@

The following table gives a schedule of topics we will cover in lecture, along with lecture slides, lab notebooks, readings, and any other resources (such as tutorials or code demonstrations). This table will be updated as necessary, as some discussions may take more or less time than anticipated.

Links to readings from peer-reviewed literature may require a Cornell login for access, and the articles will also be made available as Library Reserves in Canvas.

To save the lecture slides as a PDF, save the web version of the slides to a PDF using your browser.

Please make sure that you have updated (with a `git pull`) your local version of the class lab notebook repository ahead of lab sessions.
